Project: 

* Our team aim to design a UV Ray and Air Quality watch, which will be monitoring the chemical compounds as well as wavelength of rays that are harmful to humans. The target populations for our product are primarily patients who are prone or do have some form of skin cancer. However, it could be used as a prevention tool for the general population.
